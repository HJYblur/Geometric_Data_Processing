# Data

Some simple primitives are provided in `primitives.py`,
and more complicated meshes are available in `meshes.py`.
Properties for these meshes are available in `mesh_properties.csv`,
but note that not all meshes have all properties,
for example the mesh in `two_tori.obj` has two connected components,
but that means that it has no valid genus.

This collection of samples is very limited,
so we recommend you produce more of your own!
Blender is a good tool for creating weird meshes, for testing edge cases.
You can also find a variety of free high-resolution meshes online.
